# REFLECTION
On 22 October 2024, in the Innovation Lab, Level 3, N28, there was a special project of disassembling and assembling the PC. This is the first time I touch the hardware inside the computer. First of all, when we started disassembling the PC, the staff explained to us the name and the functions of each part, including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, storage device, and power supply. We were then instructed to reinstall the PC step by step, whereby we would get some practical experience of how these parts work together to make something work.
