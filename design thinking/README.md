# REFLECTION
My teammates, Damia, Dina, Mirza and Sheethong and me collaborated to carry out this project titled FashionMorph focusing on innovation in the fashion industry through big data and artificial intelligence (AI). This project offered valuable insights into understanding user needs and crafting solutions that address real-world challenges. By working on FashionMorph, we learned to empathize with users, analyze their pain points, and translate those insights into practical innovations using big data and artificial intelligence.
The collaborative nature of the project was particularly enriching, as it allowed each team member to contribute their unique strengths while fostering effective communication and teamwork. Navigating through the stages of empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test deepened our understanding of structured problem-solving and reinforced the importance of user-centered design.
This project also underscored the value of iterative development. Testing the prototype and receiving user feedback highlighted areas for improvement and taught us the significance of adaptability in refining solutions. It also reinforced the need to balance creativity with practicality, ensuring that the proposed solution is both innovative and feasible.
Moreover, the experience improved our technical skills, such as data analysis, 3D modeling, and app development, while enhancing soft skills like communication, collaboration, and time management. It provided a clearer perspective on how our academic knowledge can be applied to create meaningful solutions in the industry. Ultimately, this project not only strengthened our problem-solving abilities but also inspired us to pursue further opportunities where technology can positively impact everyday challenges.
