    <h1>Design Thinking</h1>
    <p>
        Working with team members - Damia, Dina, Mirza, and Shee Thong - in the <strong>FashionMorph</strong> project imparted valuable learning in innovation about the fashion industry through big data and AI. The project made us more sensitive towards user-centered design by understanding the users and their pain points, developing practical and technology-based solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The collaborative nature of the project was a highlight where each team member was able to contribute their unique strengths while fostering effective communication and teamwork. Working through the stages of design thinking - empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test - increased our capabilities for structured, user-centered approaches to problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the iterative nature of development proved instrumental in refining our solution. Testing the prototype and gathering user feedback exposed areas for improvement and taught us the importance of adaptability. This process has underscored the balance required between creativity and practicality to ensure that a solution is both innovative and feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond these design thinking principles, the project also contributed much to developing our technical skills in data analysis, 3D modeling, and app development, but also to enhancing soft skills: communication, collaboration, and time management. It showed us how to transform academic knowledge into a socially relevant application.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ultimately polished our problem-solving skills and further developed a passion in seeking other opportunities to utilize technology to solve some of the everyday challenges. The experience showed how innovation and adaptability in solution creation is crucial for a product to truly resonate with its users.
