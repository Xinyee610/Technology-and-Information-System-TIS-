# Reflection 💻

On **22 October 2024**, in the **Innovation Lab**, Level 3, N28, there was a special project involving **disassembling and assembling a PC** 🛠️. This was the first time I touched the hardware inside a computer 🖥️.

First, when we started disassembling the PC, the staff explained the **names and functions** of each part, including:

- **Motherboard** 🧩  
- **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) 🏎️  
- **RAM** (Random Access Memory) 🗂️  
- **GPU** (Graphics Processing Unit) 🎮  
- **Storage Device** 💾  
- **Power Supply** ⚡  

We were then instructed to **reinstall the PC step by step**, gaining practical experience in understanding how these parts work together to make the computer function. 🚀
